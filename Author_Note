After completing each lab I encourage the trainee to attempt to recreate each lab from scratch and run simulations. 
In order to see how information travels and better understand the concepts behind each topic. 
Also to expand configuration command knowledge. 
Then do it repeatedely until what you need to configure or investigate in topology becomes muscle memory. 
This is the way of the Network Professional!
